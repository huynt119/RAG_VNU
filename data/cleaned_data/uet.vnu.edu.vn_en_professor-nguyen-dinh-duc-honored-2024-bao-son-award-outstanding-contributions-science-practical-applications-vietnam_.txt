Professor Nguyen Dinh Duc Honored at the 2024 Bao Son Award for Outstanding Contributions to Science and Practical Applications in Vietnam
Professor, Doctor of Science (GS.TSKH) Nguyen Dinh Duc – former Chairman of the University Council at the University of Engineering and Technology, Vietnam National University, Hanoi (VNU-UET), and currently Dean of the Faculty of Civil Engineering – will officially be honored at the 2024 Bao Son Award Ceremony, one of the most prestigious and significant awards in Vietnam in the fields of science and technology.
With over 40 years of experience in scientific research and education management, Professor Nguyen Dinh Duc has made profound contributions to the development of VNU and UET, whether as an educator, a scientist, or an administrator. He has held numerous key leadership positions such as Head of the Department of Science and Technology, Head of the Training Department – VNU hanoi, Vice Rector of the University of Engineering and Technology, Chairman of the University Council of VNU-UET, and currently Head of the Department of Civil and Transportation Engineering. In all these roles, he has performed his duties with excellence.
In scientific research, Professor Nguyen Dinh Duc has published over 400 papers and scientific works, including nearly 250 articles in ISI-indexed international journals. Since 2019, he has continuously been ranked among the top 10,000 most influential scientists globally and the top 100 leading scientists in the field of Engineering and Technology – ranking 74th in the world in 2024.
Between 2020 and 2025 alone, Professor Duc has led 12 research projects at various levels, including two national-level projects, two basic research projects funded by the Nafosted Foundation, and four ministerial-level projects. He has published nearly 100 ISI papers, all in Q1/Q2 journals, with 20% in top 5% ISI journals. During this same period, nine of his PhD students have successfully defended their dissertations.
The series of works titled
“Research and Application of Advanced Three-Phase Composite Materials in Engineering”
stems from the discovery of a novel carbon-carbon composite material with a spatial three-phase structure featuring ultra-high mechanical strength, thermal resistance, and lightweight properties. These materials play a critical role in both industrial and defense sectors, especially in missile manufacturing, making them a focus of research for global superpowers. The idea of developing such ultra-durable carbon composites to improve missile range and flight time was part of Professor Duc’s Doctor of Science thesis at the Composite Materials Laboratory of the Research Institute of Machine Design, Academy of Sciences of the former Soviet Union—one of the most advanced composite laboratories in the world in the late 1990s and home to leading Russian professors and academicians.
Professor Duc’s discovery addressed a long-standing challenge in the physics and materials science communities—enhancing the mechanical and physical properties of composites while accounting for nonlinear relationships and interactions between reinforcing components. His research into ideal 3D and 4D composite structures has been widely published in leading international journals and has significantly advanced the field of new materials. It has also provided a solid foundation for practical applications in industry, daily life, and national defense.
His work has been highly recognized and appreciated by the global scientific community. He has been invited to join the editorial boards of prestigious ISI journals such as
Acta Mechanica
(Springer),
Aerospace Science and Technology
(Elsevier),
ZAMM – Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics
(Wiley), among others. He has also been invited to deliver keynote speeches at plenary sessions of major international conferences on materials science.
In Vietnam, Professor Duc has established a strong research group in advanced materials and structures, thereby founding a new scientific school in this field aimed at nurturing young talents and applying research results in practice. Between 2010 and 2012, he collaborated with the Shipbuilding Research Institute of Nha Trang University to successfully apply a three-phase polymer composite with titanium oxide particles for waterproofing ship engine foundations. This innovation was granted a patent by the Intellectual Property Office in 2016. His solution not only brought high economic efficiency to the receiving units but also opened new prospects for applications in various fields.
Sharing his thoughts on the Bao Son Award and future research directions, Professor Nguyen Dinh Duc stated:
“This is a very prestigious award that acknowledges the dedication and efforts of Vietnamese scientists and technologists. It is also a great source of encouragement for me and my colleagues to continue reaching new scientific heights and turning research results into practical contributions for the people and the nation.
In the near future, my team and I will continue our research on advanced materials such as pentagraphene, auxetics, and composites reinforced with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene, aiming to significantly improve mechanical strength, thermal and electrical conductivity for applications in electronics, renewable energy, data storage, aerospace, and especially artificial intelligence applications in engineering problems.”
On this occasion, Professor Duc extended his heartfelt gratitude and best wishes to his family, colleagues, the leadership of the University of Engineering and Technology, the VNU leadership, the Shipbuilding Research Institute of Nha Trang University, and especially to the Chairman of Bao Son Group, the Bao Son Award Council, and the 2024 Scientific Review Panel.
The recognition of Professor Nguyen Dinh Duc with the Bao Son Award this year is not only a personal honor but also a source of pride for his research team, students, University of Engineering and Technology and VNU. It serves as a powerful motivation and inspiration for young scientists, PhD candidates, graduate students, and undergraduates to confidently pursue scientific careers and devote themselves to applying research for the betterment of the country—a prosperous and powerful Vietnam.
The Bao Son Award Ceremony 2024
will take place at 7:30 PM on May 11, 2025, at the Hanoi Opera House, and will be broadcast live on VTV1.
