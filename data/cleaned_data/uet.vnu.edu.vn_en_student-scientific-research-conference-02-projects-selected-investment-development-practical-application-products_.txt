Attending the conference, there were Mr. Pham Dung Nam – Director of The Office of the “Support Innovative Startup Ecosystem in Vietnam until 2025” National Program (ISEV). For Vietnam National University, Hanoi, there were Prof. Dr. Nguyen Dinh Duc – Director of Academic Affairs Department and Ms. Nguyen Thi Hong Hanh – Deputy Director of Political – Students Affairs Department. For VNU University of Engineering and Technology, there were Prof. Dr. Pham Bao Son – Vice-Rector, Prof. Dr. Tran Xuan Tu – Head, Division of Science, Technology and International Relations, together with leaders of faculties, institutes, research centers, functional departments, and supervisors. In particular, the conference attracted the attention of many students in the university.
Student Scientific Research Conference in 2019
The Student Scientific Conference is an annual activity which is highly valued in training and scientific research of the university and also is a forum for students to present the ideas and results of research under the guidance of lecturers and scientists.
In the 2018-2019 school year, 58 scientific research projects of students were completed, from which faculties had selected 25 projects for school level competition. In particular, there are 11 scientific research projects which students used English to write research report.
Some projects are highly practical and can solve real-world problems, such as “Toward End-to-End Vietnamese Speech Synthesis Systems”, implemented in cooperation with the Infore company or the product “Research and design of automatic and real-time monitoring system for industrial-scale mushroom production factories” by students from Faculty of Mechatronics and Automation …
Prof. Dr. Pham Bao Son is speaking at the conference opening
During her opening speech, Prof. Dr. Pham Bao Son congratulated students on their excellent results in study and scientific research. The students’ scientific research conference is an annual activity for the students to build the skills of analyzing and processing information in scientific research. Especially when doing research, students have the opportunity to experience and work with lecturers in practical research projects or research topics at all levels. When the country is in need of people of digital age, students at universities in general and VNU University of Engineering and Technology in particular are the future of the country to successfully implement a digital transformation strategy or to build smart cities in Vietnam. The university facilitates maximum environment for students to develop ideas, exchange academic sessions through regular seminars so that students learn new knowledge. Since then, the school expects students to start their own businesses, creating simple problems starting from their own environment.
Mr. Pham Dung Nam expressed his pleasure to see many young students who have creative ideas from their own research. “Support Innovative Startup Ecosystem in Vietnam until 2025” National Program (referred to as Project 844) with the aim of creating a favorable environment for businesses and start-up students to develop creative ideas based on exploiting technology, intellectual property, new business model. The Program clearly identifies universities as a pioneering role in the ecosystem, to create generations of entrepreneurs and scientists with a way of honoring the knowledge of creative entrepreneurial development skills that meet their needs of market. In his speech, Mr. Pham Dung Nam also emphasized the thoughts that students need to cultivate to create successful startups, namely daring thoughts; market needs and product development self-understanding; approaching and directly finding potential customers.
Many projects are highly appreciated and have practical applications
This is the second year that the student scientific research conference has innovated the prize structure of being voted the most favorite scientific project through social networks. With the goal of further strengthening innovation activities, in 2019, the university decided to choose investment (seed funding) for some typical scientific research projects which are capable of implementing practical applications. Since then, students’ scientific research can spread and create movement for students’ scientific research as well as start-up in VNU-UET in particular and universities in general.
In 2019, there are 111 students who come from 4 Faculties engaged in scientific research with a total of 58 reports.
First prize winners from Faculty of Mechatronics and Automation
First prize winners from Faculty of Information Technology
First prize winners from Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications
First prize winners from Faculty of Engineering Physics and Nanotechnology
With the aim of promoting interactions between students and councils, student conference on science research in 2019 continues to be organized in the form of open space. Student groups performed, exchanged research ideas and results with all students and teachers through posters and product demo.
After a day’s work, with the spirit of science, objectivity and responsibility of the Review Council, the Student Scientific Research Conference 2018 – 2019 honored 08 first prize teams, 08 second prize teams and 09 teams won third prize.
In addition, a first prize project and a second prize work are voted through social networks. In particular, there are 3 projects nominated to attend the “Student Scientific Research Conference for The 2019 -2020 Academic Year at Ministry of Education and Training” and 6 projects were nominated to attend the “Student Scientific Research Conference at Vietnam National University, Hanoi”.
The Student Scientific Research Conference in the year of 2018-2019 was a great success, with a lot of good projects. That shows great interest and serious work of research student groups and supervisors. Some research topics have high practical applications, and they can be applied primarily in the real life.
