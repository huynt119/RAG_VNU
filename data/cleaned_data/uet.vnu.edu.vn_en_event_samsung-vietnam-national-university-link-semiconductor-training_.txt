Upon completion of the program, learners will be able to work at Samsung in South Korea in the chip-semiconductor sector. The university and Samsung will finance all tuition fees, including Korean language courses.
The program will begin recruitment from April and then start courses in September.
Speaking at the event, Pham Bao Son, vice president of VNU Hanoi, highlighted Vietnam’s target of training 50,000 semiconductor engineers by 2030. He expected the move to become a role model for university-business cooperation.
For his part, Samsung Vietnam CEO Choi Joo Ho said Samsung Electronics is striving to become the biggest chip producer in the world, planning an investment of $230 billion in the next 20 years to build the world’s largest semiconductor factory in South Korea. In Vietnam,
Samsung is the biggest foreign investor
with investment of over $20 billion, he added.
