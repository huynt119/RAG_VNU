I received the PhD degree from Vienna University of Technology, Austria in 2002.
I have spent years working in Japan before returning Vietnam. Since September 2011, I work as a lecturer of Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications, University of Engineering and technology, Vietnam National University Hanoi.
I am interested in doing research on advanced technologies of mobile communications networks and ICT applications for public safety and human life protection (emergency communications, disaster management).
