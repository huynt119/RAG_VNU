1. Diễn giả Prof. Maarten de Vos
Maarten De Vos, currently full Professor in the Departments of Engineering and Medicine at KU Leuven after being Associate Professor at the University of Oxford (UK) and Junior Professor at the University of Oldenburg (Germany). Since the start of his career, he focused on improving data science approaches for various healthcare applications. Currently, his Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions are used in various hospital departments, ranging from neonatology to elderly care. His pioneering research has won several innovation prizes, among which the prestigious Mobile Brain Body monitoring prize (2017), the Martin Black Prize for the best paper in Physiological Measurements (2019) and in the IEEE EMBS Benelux award for best paper in the biomedical field (2021). He has a strong interest in translational research, and advises many healthcare spin-off companies (e.g. Circadian Therapeutics, Albus Health, ArtiQ) on how to embed AI solutions in their product portfolio. He is also currently associate editor for Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and IEEE Journal of Biomedical Health Informatics and on the editorial board of Journal of neural engineering, and Nature Digital Health.
Talk title
: AI in healthcare: turning the hype into a help
Abstract
: AI is everywhere, and has the potential to disrupt also healthcare. However, particular challenges related to healthcare applications need to be addressed. Those are exciting times being at the intersection of AI and healthcare. The impact of AI in healthcare will only grow, and we are here at the right time to also unlock the potential of AI in medical endeavors. We will illustrate some of our solutions for deep learning based epilepsy and sleep detection, and explore causal AI solutions for personalising treatment recommendations.
2. Diễn giả: TS. Trần Quốc Long
Tran Quoc Long graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology with a major in Machine Learning and Computer Science. His research has focused on developing innovative machine learning methods for real-world applications in image processing and signal analysis. Notably, he has worked on medical and biological data analytics, identifying and verifying distinctive data features for the early detection of prostate cancer and ovarian cancer using mass-spectrum analysis of blood serum. Additionally, he developed a machine learning method for the accurate prediction of optimal cancer drug therapies. Currently, his AI lab collaborates with cardiologists at the Vietnam National Heart Institute on AI approaches for echocardiography diagnosis, yielding promising initial results.
Title
: How Healthcare Systems in Vietnam Work
Abstract
: Vietnam’s healthcare system is a unique amalgamation of public and private sectors, designed to provide comprehensive care to its diverse population. This talk aims to elucidate the structure, function, and challenges of the Vietnamese healthcare system, with a special focus on the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare practices. We will explore the historical evolution of healthcare in Vietnam, the roles of various governmental and non-governmental organizations, and the strategies implemented to achieve universal health coverage. Emphasis will be placed on primary healthcare, rural healthcare accessibility, and the integration of traditional medicine with modern medical practices.
