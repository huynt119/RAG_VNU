It was established in 2014 following a joint declaration issued byVietnameseandJapanese governments.Vietnam Japan University collaborates with other Japanese universities and corporations around the world.The main campus of the university is under construction inHoa Lac Hi-tech ParkinHanoi,Vietnam.The government ofJapaninvests heavily in Vietnamese higher education,and the VJU is an important part of the program. One goal of this initiative is to give international students access toJapanese higher educationand the Japanese job market. One reason for the initiative with respect to VJU is that success with respect to these goals has so far been limited.By design, the VJU is meant to grow into an international university with programs capable of supplying qualified technical graduates to both industry and the public sector.
