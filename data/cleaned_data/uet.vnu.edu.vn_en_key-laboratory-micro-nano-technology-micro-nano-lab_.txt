Key Laboratory for Micro-Nano Technology (Micro-Nano Lab)
Overview
The Micro-Nano Lab was founded in 2008. It was designed and set up as a part and the target of the VNU governmental investment project to be a key laboratory of VNU-UET in a system of the key laboratories at VNU. The laboratory operates under the university administration and management, reporting its activities directly to the rector. The Micro-Nano Lab is assigned with the mission (i) to set up and to assure a sustainable and active environment for advanced research in micro and nanotechnology, (ii) to conduct and to develop highly original and modern research ideas and projects involving inter- and cross-disciplinary academic areas of physics, chemistry, materials science and life sciences, covering from fundamental science to engineering and industrial applications and (iii) to foster selected groups of undergraduate/postgraduate students to maintain excellence in both education and research at the VNU-UET and also in the VNU in the field of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology. The laboratory draws human resources from the faculties and laboratories of VNU-UET, especially from the Faculty of Engineering Physics and Nanotechnology and the Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications. The laboratory staff currently consists of 10 full-time and adjunct, part-time staff members, and it involves dozens Master and Ph.D. students.
