Engineering Mechanics
The education program equips students with comprehensive professional knowledge, mastering the principles and laws of nature – society, basic practical skills, the ability to work independently, creatively and to solve problems in the field of Mechanical Engineering;
Graduates of the education program have in-depth theoretical knowledge in the field of education; technical mastery and practical knowledge to be able to handle complex jobs; accumulate basic knowledge of basic principles, natural and social laws in the field of education in order to develop new knowledge and be able to continue learning at a higher level; have knowledge of management, administration, law and environmental protection related to the field of education; and have the following specific knowledge and expertise:
In-depth orientation on industrial hydraulics and environment
Know and be able to apply knowledge to calculate, evaluate, and analyze hydrodynamic processes applied in industry: hydraulic machinery, oil and gas transportation and exploitation, hydrothermal exchange processes nuclear power plant…;
– Understand and be able to apply knowledge to simulate, evaluate, and analyze hydrodynamic processes applied in the environment: calculation and forecasting of flows, pollution dispersion in water and air environments gas…;
Intensive orientation in marine engineering mechanics
– Understand and be able to apply knowledge to simulate, analyze, evaluate offshore and coastal structures…;
– Know and be able to apply knowledge to calculate, simulate, evaluate and forecast hydrolithic processes and marine environment.
Specialized orientation in Mechatronics:
Understand and apply knowledge to evaluate and analyze system or process design; use modern tools to develop mechatronic systems; is capable of developing solutions for the design and development of mechatronic systems, creating “smart” production tools, as well as modern industrial systems.
In-depth orientation on space technology:
– Understand and apply knowledge about aerodynamics and propulsion technology, structural mechanics, flight mechanics, satellite technology, … for research and application of space technology.
Orientation in advanced materials and textures:
– Good basic knowledge of material mechanics and structural calculations; can design optimal components for multiphase composite materials (base, fiber and grain); Calculation and experimental determination of stress-strain, strength of materials and durability, stability of all kinds of structural plates, shells made of steel, metal and alloys, etc., as well as structures made from composite materials, concrete, nanomaterials, functional materials FGM, etc., subjected to static and dynamic loads, from which it is possible to actively design, manufacture and control the structure.
