TheHUS High School for Gifted Students, commonly known asHigh School for Gifted Students of Science(HSGS;Vietnamese:Trường Trung học phổ thông chuyên Khoa học Tự nhiên), is a specialized, most-selective (6% acceptance rate) public magnet school ofVNU University of Science, a member ofVietnam National University, Hanoisystem. The school serves as a national educational institution to nurture talented Vietnamese students who excelled at natural sciences. The largest percentage of its graduates attend the most prestigious universities in Vietnam.
The department ofMathematicswas established first in 1965, followed by the department ofPhysics; the department ofChemistryandBiologywas established in 1998.
HUS High School for Gifted Students is ranked the first in  National Science Olympiads (national qualification forInternational Science Olympiadsuch asIMO,IOI,IPhO,IChO, andIBO).This is also the high school where ProfessorNgô Bảo Châu, the first Vietnamese recipient of the Fields medal, studied.
Foundation and history
In September 1965, renowned Vietnamese mathematician and ProfessorHoàng Tụy, supported by ProfessorLê Văn Thiêm, Professor Ngụy Như Kon Tum, Professor Tạ Quang Bửu andPrime MinisterPhạm Văn Đồng, founded theSpecial class of Mathematicswith 38 students at the temporary war-time evacuation location ofUniversity of HanoiinĐại Từ District,Thái Nguyên Province. This class was the precursor of HUS High School for Gifted Students.
From 1966 to 1985, the school had the nameSpecialized School of Mathematics and Informatics, which were under the administration of the faculty of Mathematics, Mechanics, Informatics -Hanoi University of Science.
In 1998:Specialized School of Science.
In June 2010: theHigh School for Gifted Students, Hanoi University of Science.
The HUS High School for Gifted Students was honored with national awards: the 3rd degree Labor Decoration in 1985, the 2nd degree Labor Decoration in 1995, the 1st degree Labor Decoration in 2000; the Independence Decoration and theHero of Laborin 2005.
Education
Most notably, the school's mathematics and science curriculums are accelerated, and a 3-year standard curriculum at normal public high schools is condensed into the 2.5-year specialized curriculum and the 0.5-year College Entrance Exam preparation. The school also offers honours courses in the Specializations (see below) to further stretch the abilities of able students beyond the already-accelerated curriculum.
The HUS High school for Gifted Students now comprises five specializations:
- Mathematics
- Informatics
- Physics
- Chemistry
- Biology
Each department, led by ahead of department, had been under the administration of a faculty of Hanoi University of Science until 2010. In 2010, the name High School for Gifted Students was officially used with the establishment of an independent high school under the direct administration of HUS school board instead of each separate faculty.
In the National Science Olympiad, each of the departments chooses 10 talented students to representVNU University of Science.
Current school board:
- Principal: Lê Công Lợi, PhD.
- Deputy Principals:Phạm Văn Quốc, PhD.Vi Anh Tuấn, PhD.
- Phạm Văn Quốc, PhD.
- Vi Anh Tuấn, PhD.
