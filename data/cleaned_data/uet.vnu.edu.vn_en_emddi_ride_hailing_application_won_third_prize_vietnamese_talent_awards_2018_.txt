EMDDI RIDE-HAILING APPLICATION WON THE THIRD PRIZE AT THE VIETNAMESE TALENT AWARDS 2018
On November 20, 2018, the Vietnamese Talent Awards 2018 was held in Hanoi.
The EMDDI ride-hailing application developed by a group of scientists from Vietnam National University, Hanoi (VNU) won the third prize in information technology at the Vietnamese Talent Awards 2018.
Minister of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs Dao Ngoc Dzung, Vice chairman of Vietnam Study Promotion Association Pham Tat Dong, Deputy Director-General of the Vietnam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development Nguyen Thi Phuong presented the third prizes in IT.
EMDDI is a pioneering technology platform that is capable of connecting the community. The application is the connection between the service provider and the customer using the service. Transport companies can independently decide their own transport fares. With direct payment to transport companies on the basis of QR-code technology, EMDDI is a good solution to ensure business benefits. EMDDI can also be expanded into the freight sector in the era of powerful technology platforms.
The application allows hundreds of transport firms to become ride-hailing developers within 10 minutes.
The application is different from other taxi booking platforms in that the costumer only needs to install a single software (app) for all transport booking. In addition, EMDDI can distinguish administrative boundaries to automatically connect to the available local transport companies.
EMDDI is being implemented in more than 20 provinces and cities with thousands of participating vehicles, including those of taxi companies operating under the pilot project of electronic vehicles of the Ministry of Transport. In Hanoi, EMDDI has signed a cooperation agreement with 17 taxi companies under Hanoi Taxi Association.
