The 2024 ICPC Asia-Pacific Championship, hosted by the University of Engineering and Technology – Vietnam National University, took place successfully from February 29th to March 3rd, 2024. The contest not only affirmed the prestige and brand of UET in organizing international events but also contributed to marking Vietnam’s footprint in the field of information technology, nationally and specifically at the University of Engineering and Technology, on the international stage.
Bringing an international playground to Vietnam – UET asserts the role of a top university in the field of information technology.
The 2024 ICPC Asia-Pacific Championship was a gathering point for the most outstanding information technology students from leading universities in the Asia-Pacific region. With 17 times of experience organizing regional contests, Vietnam was honored to be trusted by Asian-Pacific countries to host the first-ever ICPC Asia-Pacific Championship at the University of Engineering and Technology – VNU.
The contest gathered 195 information technology students (65 teams) and 50 coaches from 40 prestigious universities in countries such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam. The teams coming to Vietnam for the finals were selected from the top ranks in the ICPC regional qualifiers in Yokohama – Japan; Seoul – South Korea; Jakarta – Indonesia; and Hue – Vietnam.
This is the most long-standing, largest, and most prestigious programming contest for university students worldwide, and also an event to praise the talent and information technology skills of international students, on the largest scale in Vietnam and the Asia-Pacific region. Participating in this contest, students have the opportunity to develop their creativity, demonstrate teamwork skills, innovate in building software programs, and test their abilities under very high time pressure.
At the opening ceremony of the contest, Associate Professor Bui The Duy – Deputy Minister of Science and Technology, nostalgically recalled the beautiful memories of his student days when he participated in the contest and later became a coach and companion to the contest. “In addition to helping students improve their programming skills, the contest also develops self-learning and teamwork skills from other teams. The skills learned from ICPC will be very useful when working in businesses or conducting research at universities. Therefore, when I returned to VNU-UET as an Associate Professor, my colleagues and I were wholeheartedly committed to bringing the ICPC contest to Vietnam so that students could enjoy this exciting contest. In addition, these contests are a great opportunity for students to develop themselves and for countries to choose talent for developing the information technology industry in the future,” Associate Professor Bui The Duy shared.
