On 11/14/2021, the University of Engineering and Technology collaborated with the Institute of Mechanics to successfully organize the 6th International Conference on Mechanical engineering and Automation “The 6th International Conference on Engineering Mechanics and Automation (ICEMA 2021)” in a direct form of online combined.
The International Conference on Engineering Mechanics and Automation (ICEMA) is a prestigious major scientific conference organized by the University of Engineering and Technology in collaboration with the Institute of Mechanics and Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology every two years. Attending the conference were Vice-Chancellor – Professor, Ph.D. Chu Duc Trinh, Deputy Professor, Ph.D. Dinh Van Manh – The Director of the Institute of Mechanics; Professor, D.Sc Nguyen Tien Khiem – President of Vietnam Mechanics Association and many leading scientists in the field of Mechanical Engineering and Automation come from universities and research institutes domestic and abroad.
Speaking at the opening of the Conference, Prof. Dr. Chu Duc Trinh emphasized, University of Engineering and Technology has chosen Engineering Mechanics and Automation as one of the spearheads to develop the University’s fields. With the mission of training high-quality and highly qualified human resources, fostering talents, developing research and applying advanced science and technology fields, pioneering in approaching regional higher education standards. and the world. Actively contribute to the development of the country’s economy and society.
Succeeding in organizing every two years proves the role, attraction and prestige of the Conference with domestic and foreign scientists. On behalf of the school leadership, the Vice-Chancellor wished the delegates and guests great success.
Also at the Conference, Deputy Professor, Ph.D. Dinh Van Manh – Director of the Institute of Mechanics thanked the efforts of the organizers and scientists, despite being affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, there were still nearly 50 reports with 10 reports with the participation of many people. participation of foreign scientists in key areas of Mechanics. Asian Research Center (ARC), Professor Nguyen Thi Anh Thu also congratulated the Conference and especially emphasized that Engineering Mechanics and Automation play an important role in most industries, organizing the 6th ICEMA conference is of great significance and very necessary.
This year’s conference includes 01 plenary sessions and 10 sub-committees meetings. At the plenary session, the Conference heard 2 invited reports from leading professors in the field of Engineering Mechanics presenting new research results as well as an overview report on new issues in modern Mechanics.
After the Plenary Session, the parallel reporting sessions of 03 subcommittees of Mechatronics and Automation, Fluid Mechanics, and Solid State Mechanics were held simultaneously in the form of live and online combination. The professional reporting sessions are run by leading scientists and experts in the field of Engineering Mechanics and Automation. After the Plenary Session, the parallel reporting sessions of 03 subcommittees of Mechatronics and Automation, Fluid Mechanics, and Solid State Mechanics were held simultaneously in the form of live and online combination. The professional reporting sessions are run by leading scientists and experts in the field of Engineering Mechanics and Automation. 49 reports presented at the conference are new, highly scientific studies and have all been approved by critics who are reputable scientists.
At the end of the conference, the Organizing Committee sent deep thanks to the units that cooperated with all the authors and researchers who made great contributions to the success of the conference. The organizers hope to continue to receive these supports for the next ICEMA conferences.
