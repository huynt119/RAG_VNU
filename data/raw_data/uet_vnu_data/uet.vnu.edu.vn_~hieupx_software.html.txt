NLP software:
CRFTagger
:
English part-of-speech tagger built on top of conditional random fields.
CRFChunker
:
English phrase chunker built on top of conditional random fields.
JTextPro
:
Java-based English text processing tool (including sentence boundary detection, 
	word tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and phrase chunking), all built on top of maximum entropy and conditional random fields.
JVnSegmenter
:
Java-based Vietnamese word segmentation tool built on top of conditional random fields.
JVnTextPro
:
Java-based Vietnamese text processing tool (including sentence boundary detection, 
	tokenization, word segmentation, and part-of-speech tagging) all built on top of maximum entropy and conditional random fields.
Machine learning software:
FlexCRFs
:
Flexible conditional random fields for segmenting and labeling sequence data. FlexCRFs, 
	written in C/C++, was designed to deal with hundreds of thousand data sequences and millions of features. FlexCRFs support both 
	first-order and second-order Markov properties. A parallel version, 
	PCRFs, is also available for running conditional random fields on massively parallel systems.
GibbsLDA++
:
A C/C++ implementation of latent Dirichlet allocation using Gibbs sampling technique 
	for parameter estimation and inference. It is fast and designed to analyze hidden/latent topic structures of large-scale 
	discrete data collections (e.g., huge collections of text/Web data).
Text/Web mining software:
PEWeb
:
A Win32 implementation of product description extraction from the Web.
