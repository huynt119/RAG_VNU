The report “An Effective Framework of Private Ethereum Blockchain Networks for Smart Grid” (in Vietnamese: “Mô hình mạng chuỗi khối Ethereum riêng tư và hiệu quả sử dụng cho lưới điện thông minh”) includes the authors of the Advanced Institute of Engineering and Technology (AVITECH) (University of Engineering and Technology – Vietnam National University) and won the Best Student Paper award at the International Conference on Advanced Technology in Communication 2021.
Using Blockchain network model in smart grid
After graduating from university, with a passion for scientific research, Do Hai Son became an active researcher at the Advanced Institute of Engineering and Technology, and continued to study at the graduate level at the University. . During the process of studying and working at the Institute, Hai Son has participated in a number of scientific research projects related to the field of Communication and the field of network security. The report “An Effective Framework of Private Ethereum Blockchain Networks for Smart Grid” is a scientific work conducted by Hai Son under the guidance of professors from the University of Engineering and Technology – VNU, Australia and Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. The content of the work is under the topic “Detection of cyber attacks and information security in Industry 4.0” is implemented by the Advanced Institute of Engineering and Technology in conjunction with the University of Technology Sydney, Australia and Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, under the sponsorship of ASEAN IVO. The report was first published at the national conference on Advanced Technologies in Communications 2021 held in Ho Chi Minh City.
Hai Sơn said: “The report winning the Best Student Paper award was a surprise to the research team in general and to myself in particular. All members are happy and proud of the achievements in half a year of research and work recognized by this award. Participating in scientific research and publishing a paper at a conference is a very different experience from being a student studying in a lecture hall. Fortunately, I was familiar with this job because my teachers facilitated me to participate in research laboratories from an early age (3
rd
year)”.
Referring to the reason for choosing the Blockchain network model, Hai Son said: “In the last two years, due to the influence of the COVID pandemic, the Blockchain network model (blockchain) has emerged as an attractive financial investment channel. in the world in general and Vietnam in particular. However, at the core of Blockchain networks is a decentralized platform that can effectively be applied to other applications. In this paper, the research team has focused on the practical implementation of the Blockchain network model, specifically the Ethereum network, for a specific purpose, which is to store data of the smart grid (one of the components of the smart grid). of the future smart city). Towards the goal of information security in smart factories when entering industry 4.0, Blockchain application is potential and has also been proposed by many other research groups in recent years due to its safety.
Ready to cooperate to deploy smart grid on Ethereum blockchain network
Through the research, the research team found that most of the current studies focus on proposing the system model, the operating protocol of the power grid, but there have not been many studies on implementing this system on other parts. specialized hardware and find ways to improve system performance. Therefore, within the framework of the article, the authors have deployed a smart grid model at household scale at the Advanced Institute of Engineering and Technology. This is the strength of the report when it comes to linking theoretical calculations, simulations with execution on real (specialized) hardware for a specific smart grid model.
