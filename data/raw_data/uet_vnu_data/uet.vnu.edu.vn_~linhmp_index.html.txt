In November 2024, the paper "LNLF-BERT: Transformer for Long Document Classification with Multiple Attention Levels" was published in the journal "IEEE Access" (ISSN 2169-3536), a SCIE Q1 journal.
In August 2024, the paper "High-performance simulation of disease outbreaks in growing-finishing pig herds raised by the precision feeding method" was published in the journal "Computers and Electronics in Agriculture" (ISSN 0168-1699), a SCIE Q1 Top 1% journal.
In July 2024, I joined a certification course in data analytics using Power BI at CDAC (Centre for Development of Advanced Computing), New Delhi, India, under the ITEC program sponsored by the Government of India.
In July 2024, the paper on autonomous vehicles (Evaluation of Reinforcement Learning Algorithms Applied to an Autonomous Car Model for Educational Purposes) was presented at the ICCSA 2024 conference (QUALIS rank B1) in Hanoi, Vietnam.
In May 2024, I received a certificate of merit from the Minister of Education and Training of Vietnam for excellent completion of tasks from the 2021-2022 to 2022-2023 academic years.
In May 2024, the student research group on autonomous vehicles that I co-directed won first prize at the VNU University of Engineering and Technology level.
